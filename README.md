- 👋 Hi, I’m @patriciabordoli
- 👀 I'm interested in humanistic research through data. I'm a documentalist with a background in communications and anthropology, and I'm currently doing a master's in data science.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning natural language processing techniques and machine learning applied to transport, tourism or land use data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve interdisciplinary research combining data science with humanistic studies.
